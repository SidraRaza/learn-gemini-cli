## 🆘 What Does `/help` Do?

The `/help` command is used to **get assistance** in any program, tool, or CLI (Command Line Interface).

When you type `/help` or `help`, it:
- Displays all **available commands** you can use.
- Provides a **short explanation** of what each command does — so you can understand their purpose.

### 💻 Example:
```bash
gemini /help

# 🧭 Useful Command: Ctrl + L

## 🧹 What Does `Ctrl + L` Do?

The **`Ctrl + L`** keyboard shortcut is used in the **command line or terminal** to:

- **Clear the screen** — it removes all previous commands and outputs from view.  
- It gives you a **clean workspace** while keeping the command history in memory (you can still scroll up to see old commands).

### 💻 Example:
If your terminal looks cluttered with too many outputs, simply press:


# 📘 Command: /docs

## 📄 What Does `/docs` Do?

The **`/docs`** command is commonly used in **CLI tools** or **software documentation systems** to:

- Open or display the **official documentation** related to that tool.  
- Provide **detailed usage guides, examples, and configuration instructions.**

### 💻 Example:
```bash
gemini /docs

# 🧰 Command: /tools

## ⚙️ What Does `/tools` Do?

The **`/tools`** command is generally used in **CLI (Command Line Interface)** environments or **AI tools** to:

- Display a list of **available tools, plugins, or features** that the system can use.  
- Show details about what each tool does and how you can use it in your commands or prompts.

### 💻 Example:
```bash
gemini /tools
