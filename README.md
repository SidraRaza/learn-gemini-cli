## 🆘 What Does `/help` Do?

The `/help` command is used to **get assistance** in any program, tool, or CLI (Command Line Interface).

When you type `/help` or `help`, it:
- Displays all **available commands** you can use.
- Provides a **short explanation** of what each command does — so you can understand their purpose.

### 💻 Example:
```bash
gemini /help
